# Query Engine App

### Input Event Stream
We use the event stream generated by EventGenerator App, 
that contains event of different Type (from A to E) and POGs.

### Query input
Query can be given in format "window_time eventType, 
NOT_eventType, eventType" for e.x"10 A,NOT_B,C,D".  
Time should be given in seconds, and event type should be an upper case
letter from A to E for positive event and NOT_+  an upper case
letter from A to E for negative event.
